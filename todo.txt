TODO:
Try removing colors that have only 1 pixel ?
Lighten the colors a bit so that they are more pastelly
What if the predominant color is grey with no interesting colors ? - use random interesting color ?
Any range of colors to completely avoid?
When brightness is increased it could end up in a very grey tone - maybe limit how grey it can be ?
Maybe in the end - let developers choose their own colors - just start with these ones on release
PIL.ImageEnhance = brighten image
